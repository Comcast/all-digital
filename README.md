# All Digital CSS

Welcome to the All Digital brought to you by Comcast.

* Built for unity: Using the All Digital markup and CSS framework produces UIs that reflect the Comcast All Digital look and feel.
* Focused on Simplicity: What sets All Digital apart is what we've left out. The goal of All Digital was to stay slim and not be overly opinioned. All Digital will provide common elements, but not hinder your application's ability to grow on its own.
* Continuously updated: All Digital is used in production on several Comcast properties. We're always fixing issues and updating with the latest decisions from the [design team](http://design.comcast.com/).
